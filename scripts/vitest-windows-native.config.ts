/**
 * Bounded Windows-native foundation suite (first native-verification cut).
 *
 * Scope: the shared project-folder safety tests (pinned directory and
 * confinement), the daemon data-directory lock, real Windows-job /
 * ConPTY fixtures, plus pure Windows units (shell selection, path policy,
 * batch command, job/identity contracts, ConPTY backend units, Windows
 * process supervision). No root POSIX process suite, no
 * recorder, no provider CLIs.
 *
 * Isolation: reuses the repo's test-home global setup and per-file setup so
 * the enclosing-repository guard stays enforced. Nothing here weakens or
 * disables that guard.
 *
 * Fail-closed: workspace tests require dist/descriptor.node (built natively
 * by build.ts in CI before this config runs); a missing native binary on
 * Windows fails, never skips.
 *
 * Run: node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run --config scripts/vitest-windows-native.config.ts
 * Never: bun test (Bun's own runner).
